Initial state: Only in one DC (Reston or Chicago) – Serves traffic in either Reston or Chicago in the normal state
Traffic movement for DMS involves a series of steps performed at the server & F5 level. It also involves steps to be executed by different teams. The detailed failover document to move the entire DC’s traffic is present in our team’s share point location (link below).

Steps:
1, Traffic movement for DMS is done only in the GTM layer at the F5 level.
2, LTM URLs are always balanced and not touched while diverting traffic at the F5 level.
3, Some of the JVMs in the passive DC will be kept in stopped state. So, the respective pools will be marked down in LTM but still enabled.
4, Based on the DC in which the activity is planned or issue is observed, traffic has to be moved to the alternate DC by following the steps mentioned in the failover document in its sequence.
5, Post completion of the activity, traffic can be again moved to the ‘DC’ requested by the application team by following the same set of steps mentioned above.
Link to the automated jobs in rundeck to divert the traffic for the application is given below,
