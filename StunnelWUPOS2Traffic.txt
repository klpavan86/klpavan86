1) Chicago 2.0 Disable disable at GTM 
2) Chicago ltm --> Put chicago 2.0 pool members in disabled mode and reston members in enabled mode
3) wait for 15 mins
4) Force offline chicago pool members in chicago ltm and reston ltm . i.e chicago pool members should be in force offline in both Reston LTM & Chicago LTM
 
5) Stunnel change on 10.46.32.193

*******************************************************
once all these 6 steps got completed
 
1) enable 10.46.32.193 alone on both  wupos 2.0 clan & ilan aplb --> Initially all jvm's would be in enabled status , but we will disable the rest of jvm;s in all 6 2.0 aplb apart from 10.46.32.193
2) Once above step got completed 10.46.32.193 is in INIT OK and other members would be in INIT DRN OK in all 6 2.0 aplb
3) Enable chicago local pool members in chicago ltm for sanity
4) ETOC to perform sanity for stunnel i.e sanity will be going through 10.46.32.193 at this time
************************************************
With this sanity for stunnel ecr completes
5) Once sanity completed by ETOC enable all jvm's which we had disabled in 6 2.0 aplb
 
6) Ask ETOC team to proceed with regular sanity in chicago 2.0
7) Once sanity completed for 2.0 then enable cross dc pool members i.e at this time in chicago ltm --> chicago memebrs are in enabled state and reston mebers are in disabled status
in Reston ltm --> Reston members are in enabled status & chicago mebers are in disabled status
