Hello Yesunadam.  Going back looking through some emails, I found one from Suki which is attached.

 

She indicated the proxies as listed below.

 

RT Validation Proxy:

Proxy URL – UAT:  https://coreyrevuatprxy.prod.wudip.com/dukeenergynew/png/v1/payments/lookup

 

RT Posting Proxy

Proxy URL – UAT: https://coreyrevuatprxy.prod.wudip.com/dukeenergynew/png/v1/payments/postpayment

 

There is a slight difference in the proxy URLs shown below already in production, and the ones Suki has listed above.
