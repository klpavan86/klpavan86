since there was typo in cronjob, we observers below error, we corrected with CRC teams approval post that it worked well
webadm@WUWVC9ASRTRA04:~ **** This is a PROD server Please be extra careful **** RESTON $ crontab -e
crontab: installing new crontab
"/tmp/crontab.RXmqvh":65: bad minute
errors in crontab file, can't install.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this change we wanted to modify the crontab on 10.45.16.83 as:
From: 0 * * * * /apps/rtra/batch/RuleHitsCount.sh 2>&1
To: 0/30 * * * * /apps/rtra/batch/RuleHitsCount.sh 2>&1

But it was giving syntax error due to 0/30 (even actually it is correct)

So, as you all know, we modified as:
0,30 * * * * /apps/rtra/batch/RuleHitsCount.sh 2>&1

Means we replaced / with , in the expression and it worked well.
