Hi All,

We have productionized new servers for IWRA, the new servers are live from 28th Jan and all batches are running on it without any issue.

As part of this new setup following batches are verified.

 

Idea batch
Nigeria batch
StarsFeedBatch
STARS_LOAD_FEED_SEND_EMAIL_run
ObjReportBatch
Agentfeed batch
pharos_agents_files_sftp
PharosFailedAttemptsProcessor
PharosFailedRulesHitProcessor
Tibcofeed
 

Challenges-

There was no migration step available especially for batches movement. We had to learn and setup, required multiple team coordination, like ACM, Pharos, Network, …
Team had to run all the batches gradually with Production data, we raised multiple CR’s and involved AMS as well.
Some of the scripts directly configured on Prod by AMS over time, even current team no idea about some of them- this made debugging issues difficult.
 

Going forward all deployments will be done on new servers only.

 

Next steps:

We will be planning Csmart config change on next week release for connecting to new IWRA systems to pull latest drl's.
Working on finding source server from where Operator feed comes to IWRA system.
 

@RAJ KUMAR DUBEY

Please raise request to @ITIO-Run-MW-WebHosting team to handover new Prod servers to them for supporting prod deployments.

 

Thank you @Virbhadra Anantrao Kaulwar for dev and verification support.

Thank you @Sirisha Somana @Simhadri Yugandhar @ArjunYadav Bandi @Karmega Moorthi Team for the support.
